### Ever wanted to relive the nostalgia that those magic 8 balls gave you? Good news! Now you can!
## How it works:

Using React I have created a simple 8 ball (designed with CSS) that displays an answer to the user's question.
Simply hover your mouse over the 8 ball to shake it, and reveal the answer to all your problems.

### How to install it:

`git clone https://github.com/alevalenti44/8ballwithreact.git`

`npm install`

`npm start`
